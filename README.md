Arduino head ball game


Game: 
https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/head-soccer-2-player

Instructions:

Download the all project, and open your ide (I'm using "Arduino ide").  Connect two Arduino boards from "circuit playground", and upload "Fotball_Player1" to one of the Arduino board, and upload "Fotball_Player2" to the other board (don't forget to change ports between the uploads).
(you can also play just one player in the game, so you don't have to use 2 boards necessary).
Switch the slideSwitch on the boards to settle your Arduino take control on your boards.
Start play!
